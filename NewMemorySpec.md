# Dot Memory Layer: Full Implementation Plan (Detailed)

## Overview
This document defines the full technical implementation for Dot's memory system, broken down into precise agent responsibilities, schema specifications, embedding logic, and interaction rules across the memory pyramid.

It reflects the latest updates:
- Many-to-many mapping between ChunkEmbedding and Episode
- Split agent responsibilities (4-core agents)
- Thought = structural abstraction across Episodes
- Embedding narrative and thought-level content
- Crash-course upload ingestion and onboarding logic

---

## 🔁 1. Agent Architecture (Code Modularization)

### 1.1 ingestionAgent.js (new)
- **Trigger:** After new `RawData` row is written
- **Source files impacted:**
  - Add queue processor in `ingestionAgent.js`
  - Adjust `memoryManager.service.js` to emit queue jobs instead of inline processing
- **Steps:**
  1. Run `evaluateImportance(content)`
  2. If above threshold, run `chunkContent(content)` → 1–N chunks
  3. For each chunk:
     - Call `generateEmbedding(text)`
     - Write `ChunkEmbedding`
     - Emit event `chunk.added` with metadata `{ chunkId, userId }`
- **Example:**
  ```ts
  await embeddingService.generateEmbedding("Playing Rach 2 tonight...");
  ```
- **Changes needed:**
  - Refactor `generateAndStoreEmbeddings()` → extracted into ingestionAgent

### 1.2 episodeAgent.js (new)
- **Trigger:** `chunk.added` event
- **Steps:**
  1. Fetch chunk vector from Weaviate or cache
  2. Vector match against `EpisodeEmbedding` centroids
  3. If cosine ≥ 0.82:
     - Add link to `_ChunkEpisodes` join table
     - Recalculate `Episode.narrative`
     - Update `Episode.centroidVectorId` with new embedding of summary
     - Emit `episode.updated`
  4. If no matches, emit `chunk.orphan`
- **Changes needed:**
  - Create `ChunkEpisodes` join table
  - Add `updateEpisodeCentroid()` function

### 1.3 consolidationAgent.js (new)
- **Trigger:** Cron every 3h or `upload.boost` or ≥200 orphaned chunks
- **Steps:**
  1. Fetch all `ChunkEmbedding` without episodes
  2. Cluster via DBSCAN or k-means (embedding distance metric)
  3. For each cluster:
     - Check if centroid matches existing Episode → merge or create
     - Summarize → new `Episode.narrative`
     - Generate centroid embedding
     - Add emotionTags via classification
     - Write new `Episode` rows and link chunks
     - Create/update KG nodes
     - Emit `episode.created`
- **Changes needed:**
  - Move `clusterChunks()` logic from memoryManager → consolidationAgent

### 1.4 thoughtAgent.js (new)
- **Trigger:** Daily at 4am or ≥10 `episode.updated` in 24h
- **Steps:**
  1. Pull latest Episodes and their KG nodes
  2. Group episodes sharing ≥2 entities
  3. If new cluster is not already covered → synthesize `Thought`
  4. Generate embedding for `Thought.name + description`
  5. Insert into `Thought` table with linked `EpisodeThoughts`
- **Example output:**
  - th_03: "Parents as Bedrock of Discipline" → ep_106, ep_107

## 🧱 2. Schema & Database

### Updated Prisma Schema
```prisma
model User {
  id               String   @id @default(cuid())
  email            String?  @unique
  createdAt        DateTime @default(now())
  rawData          RawData[]
  episodes         Episode[]
  thoughts         Thought[]
}

model RawData {

  userId           String
  user             User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

}
```

## 🔍 3. Embedding Infrastructure

| Layer | Vector | Description | DB field |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Chunk | yes    | Each chunk from RawData | ChunkEmbedding.vectorId |
| Episode | yes  | Summary or average vector of its chunks | Episode.centroidVectorId |
| Thought | yes  | Embedding of name + description | Thought.vectorId |

---

## 📦 4. Special Modes

### 4.1 Onboarding
- Inputs flagged `forceImportant = true`
- Always chunked + embedded regardless of importance score
- May trigger immediate Episode if cohesive pattern found

### 4.2 Crash-Course Uploads
- File is chunked via PDF or Markdown parser
- RawData rows created
- Embeddings streamed in parallel
- After final chunk → fire `upload.boost` to trigger `consolidationAgent`
- Generates Episodes and immediate dream cards

---

## 🔁 5. RetrievalAgent Enhancements

- Add class `ThoughtEmbedding` to Weaviate (fields: name, vectorId, userId)
- In `retrieveMemories(userId, query)`:
  1. Embed query → `q`
  2. Vector search: `EpisodeEmbedding` (centroid)
  3. Expand via `ThoughtEmbedding` overlay (filter by type)
  4. Optionally quote raw chunks from `ChunkEmbedding` if needed

---

## 🧪 6. Testing Plan

### Unit
- test `importanceScore()` ranges
- test `matchChunkToEpisodes()` precision
- test `mergeEpisodeNarrative()` logic

### E2E
- Upload memoir (PDF)
- Watch dream-card generation
- Ask Dot about abstract theme → Thought match
- Ask Dot for quote → Chunk retrieval

---

## ✅ Rollout Phases

### Phase 1: Ingestion
- Refactor RawData+Embedding logic
- Split out ingestionAgent

### Phase 2: Episode Engine
- Add join table and attach logic
- Deploy episodeAgent + centroid update

### Phase 3: Consolidation
- Deploy async clustering engine
- Add crash-course trigger

### Phase 4: Thought Reasoning
- Enable graph scan + abstract layer
- Thought embedding + vector overlay in retrieval

# Dot Memory Agent Event Flow Diagram & Scaffolding

This document provides a clear reference for developers to understand how the four core memory agents (Ingestion, Episode, Consolidation, and Thought) communicate and trigger each other via events and queues using BullMQ.

---

## 🎯 Overview of Agent Responsibilities

### ingestionAgent.js
- Trigger: New RawData created
- Responsibilities:
  - Score importance
  - Chunk and embed if important
  - Store `ChunkEmbedding`
  - Emit `chunk.added`

### episodeAgent.js
- Trigger: `chunk.added`
- Responsibilities:
  - Search for existing Episode matches
  - If matched: attach chunk + update centroid
  - Else: emit `chunk.orphan`

### consolidationAgent.js
- Trigger: `chunk.orphan` backlog ≥ threshold, cron (3h), or `upload.boost`
- Responsibilities:
  - Cluster orphaned chunks
  - Merge with or create new Episodes
  - Update centroids and narratives
  - Extract KG entities and update graph
  - Emit `episode.created` / `episode.updated`

### thoughtAgent.js
- Trigger: `episode.updated`, cron (4 AM), or batch trigger
- Responsibilities:
  - Find cross-episode themes via KG scan
  - Generate `Thought` entries
  - Embed Thought title + description
  - Emit `thought.created`

---

## ⚙️ Event Bus (BullMQ Jobs per Agent)

### Event Types
- `chunk.added`
- `chunk.orphan`
- `upload.boost`
- `episode.updated`
- `episode.created`
- `thought.created`

## ⛓️ Full Agent Flow

```

[ingestionAgent] ──► chunk.added
                         ↓
                  [episodeAgent] ──► chunk.orphan (if unmatched)

                         ↓
                  [thoughtAgent] ──► thought.created
```

---

## 🔨 Agent Queue Scaffolding (example)

### ingestionAgent.js
```ts
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';

const ingestionQueue = new Queue('ingestion');
const ingestionWorker = new Worker('ingestion', async job => {
  const { rawDataId } = job.data;
  // Load RawData, score, chunk, embed
  // Write ChunkEmbedding
  // Emit: chunkQueue.add('chunk.added', { chunkId, userId })
});
```

### episodeAgent.js
```ts
const chunkQueue = new Queue('chunk');
const episodeWorker = new Worker('chunk', async job => {
  if (job.name === 'chunk.added') {
    const { chunkId, userId } = job.data;
    // Try attach to Episode
    // If none found: orphanQueue.add('chunk.orphan', { chunkId, userId })
  }
});
```

### consolidationAgent.js
```ts
const orphanQueue = new Queue('orphan');
const consolidationWorker = new Worker('orphan', async job => {
  // Check for >200 orphans or run every 3h via cron
  // Cluster → create Episode → emit: episodeQueue.add('episode.created', { episodeId })
});
```

### thoughtAgent.js
```ts
const episodeQueue = new Queue('episode');
const thoughtWorker = new Worker('episode', async job => {
  if (job.name === 'episode.updated' || job.name === 'episode.created') {
    // Check if ≥2 episodes share KG tags
    // Create Thought + emit thought.created
  }
});
```

---

## 📌 Notes
- All queues configured with retry policies and dead-letter queues
- Sentry or logging middleware should be added to each Worker
- Add queue dashboard like Arena or Bull Board for monitoring

---

## ✅ Next Steps
1. Create agent files and shared `queues.js`
2. Migrate core logic out of `memoryManager.service.js`
3. Wire queues to `chat.controller.js` and `fileUpload.service.js`
4. Test local flow using mocked Weaviate/Prisma calls
5. Add instrumentation and alerts

This event-driven memory architecture gives Dot true long-term memory with reliable real-time and offline consolidation.

Below is a “just-right” decomposition of the current memoryManager monolith into four single-purpose agents, while keeping file names, tables, and helper utilities unchanged.

The goal is clarity of ownership, easy scaling, and minimal cross-talk.

⸻

0 · Quick map

New worker file (BullMQ queue)	Key verbs it owns	Triggers	Publishes events
ingestionAgent.js	score → chunk → embed	every RawData insert	chunk.added
episodeAgent.js	attach → update centroid	each chunk.added	episode.updatedchunk.orphan
consolidationAgent.js	cluster orphans → create / merge episodes	cron (3 h) or upload.boostor ≥200 chunk.orphan	episode.created / episode.updated
thoughtAgent.js	scan episodes → create thoughts	daily (4 am) or episode.updated (≥n)	thought.created

chat.controller.js continues to call RetrievalAgent (already inside memoryManager.retrieveMemories).

⸻

1 · Responsibilities in detail

1. ingestionAgent.js

RawData → score → chunk → embed → store(ChunkEmbedding) → event(chunk.added)

Uses the exact methods you already have (evaluateImportance, chunkContent, generateEmbedding).

2. episodeAgent.js

on(chunk.added):
    sim = cosine(chunk.vector , Episode.centroid)
    if sim ≥ 0.82:
        link chunk ⇄ episode(s)
        recalc centroid & narrative
        emit episode.updated
    else:
        emit chunk.orphan

Leverages your current matchChunkToEpisodes() and updateCentroid() helpers.

3. consolidationAgent.js

cron (3h) OR chunk.orphan backlog ≥ 200 OR upload.boost:
    orphanChunks = prisma.chunkEmbedding.findMany(episodes none)
    clusters = DBSCAN(orphanChunks)
    for cluster in clusters:
        if close to existing episode → merge
        else → create Episode (+ KG write)
        emit episode.created

Re-uses the clustering code you already prototyped in MemoryManager.chunk....

4. thoughtAgent.js

daily 04:00 OR when 10+ episode.updated in 24h:
    groups = graphService.communityDetect(Episode KG)
    for g in groups where |g| ≥ 2:
        if no existing Thought: create Thought(type,name,episodes[])
    emit thought.created

No embeddings needed; it just writes rows + KG edges.

⸻

2 · Event bus (Redis pub/sub)

Small payloads:

{ "type": "chunk.added", "chunkId": "ck_123", "userId": "u1" }
{ "type": "episode.updated", "episodeId": "ep_9", "userId": "u1" }
{ "type": "upload.boost", "userId": "u1" }

UI listens only to episode.created, thought.created for dream cards & energy ring.

⸻

3 · Code changes checklist

File	Change
memoryManager.service.js	Strip down to helper library (evaluateImportance, chunkContent, matchChunkToEpisodes, updateCentroid, clusterChunks)
/agents/ingestionAgent.js	Wrap the live part of processRawData
/agents/episodeAgent.js	New worker; uses helpers
/agents/consolidationAgent.js	New worker; schedule via BullMQ repeat job
/agents/thoughtAgent.js	New worker; lightweight

No DB schema change required beyond what we already upgraded (many-to-many join table).

⸻

4 · Why this split is “just right”
	•	IngestionAgent touches Weaviate & PostgreSQL only — maximum parallelism.
	•	EpisodeAgent is CPU-light (vector similarity) and keeps the centroids up-to-date in real time.
	•	ConsolidationAgent runs heavier clustering but infrequently; isolates any long-running tasks.
	•	ThoughtAgent is cheap and purely analytical; can even run on a lower-priority node.

Each agent can be autoscaled or paused without side effects.

⸻

TL;DR

Keep the existing utilities.
Create four lightweight workers to own distinct verbs:

ingest → attach → consolidate → reflect

…and Dot’s memory remains consistent, scalable, and easy to reason about.

Below is a play-by-play “trace file” of what would happen if Steve Jobs were Dot’s user during his first 24 hours.
Times are in PDT, table rows are abbreviated, and agent events are italic-smallcaps.

09 : 00  — Day-0 onboarding (live chat)

Step	Data / Event	Who does it	Notes
1	RawData rd_001content: “I’m obsessed with building insanely great products that marry tech & liberal arts.”	Chat API	
2	INGESTION_AGENT runs evaluateImportance → 0.78		Length + passion → high
3	chunkContent keeps it as single chunk		
4	generateEmbedding → vector v₁		
5	ChunkEmbedding ce_001 written		
6	EPISODE_AGENT vector-matches v₁ against existing centroids → no hit		Emits chunk.orphan
7	EPISODE_AGENT does nothing else		



⸻

09 : 03  — Streak of live chat

Steve adds: “When I was ten my dad showed me how to build a Heathkit: that shaped my design ethic.”
Another RawData row → embedding ce_002; still no centroid match → chunk.orphan.

⸻

09 : 15  — Onboarding answer #3

“Five-year goal? Replace the phone, the wallet, and the camera with one object in your pocket.”

Importance 0.85 → ce_003 (orphan).

Chunk.orphan backlog now = 3.

⸻

09 : 20  — CONSOLIDATION_AGENT kicks in (rule: ≥3 orphans within 30 min)

Stage	Action
DBSCAN	clusters {ce_001, ce_002, ce_003} distance < 0.3
Episode	ep_100 createdtitle “Foundational Product Philosophy”centroid = mean(v₁,v₂,v₃)
KG Extract	Nodes: Value:Craftsmanship, Trait:RealityDistortion, Goal:OneDevice
Links	Joins table writes (ce_001…ce_003 → ep_100)
Events	episode.created(ep_100)

Front-end sees the event ▶︎ Dream-card placeholder appears immediately.

⸻

10 : 00  — Steve uploads “Keynotes_2001-2007.pdf” (48 pages)

fileUpload.service.js saves file, slices into 610 RawData chunks rd_0500….
All flagged source='upload'.

IngestionAgent streams them:
	•	average importance after heuristic bump → 0.74
	•	creates 610 ChunkEmbeddings.

After last chunk it emits upload.boost.

⸻

10 : 04  — CONSOLIDATION_AGENT — crash-course mode

Pass	Result
Cluster orphan set (610 items)	finds 4 dense clusters
Episodes created	ep_201 “iPod Disruption 2001” (130 chunks)ep_202 “Intel Transition 2005” (70)…ep_203 “iPhone Launch Journey” (260)…ep_204 “Design Principles Anthology” (150)
Existing episode match	none (first bulk upload)
Events	4×episode.created

10 : 10  — Thought synthesis (triggered because 4 new episodes share nodes)

ThoughtAgent notices:
	•	Value:End-to-end Control appears in ≥3 episodes
	•	Theme:Marrying Tech & Liberal Arts appears in 2

Creates:

Thought	Episodes	Type
th_01 “End-to-End Control is Quality”	201, 203, 204	value
th_02 “Technology × Humanities”	100, 204	theme

Events: thought.created.

Front-end: 3D graph lights up; energy ring jumps by +4.

⸻

10 : 30  — Steve asks:

“Dot, what did I say about skeuomorphic icons in my 2003 design jam?”

RetrievalAgent:
	1.	Embed query → vector q.
	2.	Episode search: nearest centroids returns ep_204 (0.88) and ep_202 (0.62).
	3.	Thought overlay: finds th_02.
	4.	Drill-down: gets top 3 chunks inside ep_204 with keyword “skeuomorphic”.

Returns MemoryHint:

Episode: Design Principles Anthology
Quote: “Skeuomorphism adds warmth but mustn’t become kitsch — felt-leather calendars are a slippery slope.” (Aug 2003 workshop)

Dot weaves it into reply.

Overnight 02 : 00  — Daily dream cycle

ThoughtAgent runs but no new patterns → emits a “dream postcard” summarising yesterday’s upload (“iPhone journey crystallised into a single vault venturing into the pocket realm”).

Recap – agents in play

RawData ➟ INGESTION_AGENT        (scores, chunks, embeds, chunk.added)
        ➟ EPISODE_AGENT          (fast attach or chunk.orphan)
chunk.orphan ➟ CONSOLIDATION_AGENT (cluster, create/merge episodes)

Two agents (“MemoryManager” split into 4 workers but conceptually ingestion / episodes / consolidation / thoughts) handled everything, giving Dot real-time recall and rich overnight insights for an artist juggling pianist, educator, dad, author roles.

Below is an extended 48-hour “flight-recorder” of Dot’s backend when Lang Lang talks about
	•	his wife Gina Alice Redlinger (also a pianist),
	•	his parents (Dad: Guo-ren, a keen erhu player; Mum: Zhao Ping),
	•	childhood memories of six-hour practice marathons in Shenyang.

All actions follow the lean four-agent split we agreed on:

INGESTION_AGENT  →  EPISODE_AGENT  →  CONSOLIDATION_AGENT  →  THOUGHT_AGENT

All nullable foreign-key fields (perspectiveOwner, subject) are null where they don’t apply.

This table snapshot should let you (or a teammate) picture exactly what Dot knows, how episodes clump chunks, and how higher-level thoughts connect those episodes.

Short answer
	•	Episodes → Yes.
The narrative field is embedded every time an episode is created or updated, and that vector is stored under centroidVectorId.
	•	Thoughts → Recommended Yes, but optional.
Embedding the title + description of each Thought gives you semantic recall of high-level themes. It only costs one tiny vector per Thought and pays off whenever a user asks abstract questions (“What are my recurring values?”).

Below is the precise flow so you can see where the vectors are generated and where they live.

⸻

1. Episode embedding (already in place)

Moment	Code path	What happens
New episode created or chunk added	consolidationAgent → updateEpisodeCentroid()	• Concatenate latest narrative (or a 400-token summary).• aiService.generateEmbedding() → 768-dim vector.• Store vector in Weaviate class EpisodeEmbedding (id = ep_xxx).• Save returned UUID → Episode.centroidVectorId.

Usage:
RetrievalAgent always queries Episode centroids first (nearVector on that class).
So the narrative vector is essential and already being used.

⸻

2. Thought embedding (quick addition)

Moment	Code path to add	Action
Thought created / updated	thoughtAgent after DB insert	```js
const vec = aiService.generateEmbedding(${thought.name}. ${thought.description ?? ''});		
await weaviate.upsert(‘ThoughtEmbedding’, thought.id, vec, { userId });		
await prisma.thought.update({ where: {id}, data: { vectorId: weavUuid }});		

*Create a **`ThoughtEmbedding`** class in Weaviate (vectorizer = none, props = `name, type, userId, createdAt`).*

**Benefits**

* Lets Dot answer meta-queries:  
  “Remind me of the themes that connect my duets with Gina and my son.”  
  → RetrievalAgent vector-searches Thought embeddings and returns `th_05`.
* No heavy storage: if you had 500 Thoughts that’s 500 × 768 floats ≈ 1 MB.

---

## 3. Storage summary

| Weaviate class            | Vector represents                    | Source text                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory** (already)      | individual chunk                    | `ChunkEmbedding.content`                         |
| **EpisodeEmbedding**      | episode centroid                    | auto-summary of `Episode.narrative`              |
| **ThoughtEmbedding** ★new | abstract pattern / value / theme    | `Thought.name + Thought.description`             |

---

## 4. Retrieval algorithm (unchanged but richer)

1. Search **EpisodeEmbedding** → top k.  
2. Expand via **ThoughtEmbedding** if query is abstract or no good match.  
3. (Optional) fall back to raw **Memory** chunks.

This keeps latency < 250 ms while letting Dot surface both stories *and* overarching insights.

---

### Implementation effort

* **Episode side**: already done (`centroidVectorId`).  
* **Thought side**: ~25 lines in `thoughtAgent.js`, plus one Weaviate schema call during startup.

> **Bottom line:**  
> Keep embedding Episodes (already critical) and add a one-shot embedding for each Thought—it’s cheap, consistent, and makes Dot smarter at abstract reasoning.

Yes — for this simplified system, I’m recommending we combine semantic chunks and embeddings into a single ChunkEmbedding table.

⸻

Why this is a good idea

Reason	Explanation
1. One row = one memory unit	You’re only embedding important chunks (after filtering). These are your semantic units. No need to track pre-embedding chunks separately.
2. Minimizes duplication	Instead of a SemanticChunk table feeding into a ChunkEmbedding, we now store: text = RawData, semantic meaning = vector, and location = rawDataId.
3. Traceability is preserved	Each embedding row still links directly back to its source paragraph via rawDataId, so you can show the original story verbatim when needed.
4. Keeps things cleanly layered	In the pyramid model:
RawData → ChunkEmbedding (if important) → Episode (if clustered).	
No shadow tables or intermediate artifacts.	



⸻

You still retain full functionality

Task	Still possible with this design
Re-embedding later	Just call .generateEmbedding() on RawData.content where importanceScore ≥ threshold.
Chunk-level filtering	Store chunkIndex in ChunkEmbedding if needed, or truncate long messages to single semantic units before embedding.
Trace vector to story	Use rawDataId to retrieve original sentence/paragraph.



⸻

If you eventually support multiple chunks per RawData entry…

Then you can still keep ChunkEmbedding, but add a chunkIndex: Int and content: String field to allow multi-chunk extraction per RawData.

model ChunkEmbedding {
  ...
  chunkIndex     Int
  content        String  // The chunked portion of RawData.content
}

But until you support that granularity, combining them is cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain.

⸻

TL;DR

Yes, merging chunks + embedding into a single ChunkEmbedding table is ideal for your simplified architecture—less surface area, same power.

Short answer:
→ Yes, for now. I recommend you remove topicId, perspectiveOwnerId, and subjectId from the ChunkEmbedding layer.
→ But you should still keep “conceptual equivalents” (maybe at the Episode or Thought level) if you want Dot to reason over perspectives later.
I’ll break it down carefully:

⸻

1 · Why these fields originally existed

Field	Original purpose
topicId	Tag conversations by explicit topics (e.g., “college planning”, “self-esteem”).
perspectiveOwnerId	Represent whose point of view the data comes from (e.g., user speaking about themselves vs about a family member).
subjectId	Who/what is the subject of the conversation (user vs someone else).



⸻

2 · Why you can drop them from ChunkEmbedding

Reason	Details
Chunks are low-level atoms	At chunk level, it’s often ambiguous. Example: A paragraph might mention both Mom and career in one breath. Perspective and subject become messy to assign at atom-level.
Episodes are where meaning crystalizes	Once you cluster related thoughts into an Episode (e.g., “Summer Trip to China” or “Career Reassessment 2025”), THEN it’s easier and more meaningful to assign perspectiveOwner and subject.
Saves complexity in writes	Otherwise, every chunk embedding needs complicated real-time NER + speaker attribution pipelines. Way too heavy for MVP.



⸻

3 · Where these concepts should live instead

Field	Move to…	How
topicId	Derived later based on clustered Episode tags or emerging Thought themes (e.g., “education”, “well-being”).	
perspectiveOwnerId	Save at the Episode level if the entire cluster narrates from the user’s point of view or someone else’s (e.g., an Episode like “Mom’s illness” would have subject = Mom).	
subjectId	Also Episode-level (or even Thought-level for cross-episode themes).	

Thus, perspective and subject become macro-level metadata, assigned once per Episode or Thought, not per chunk.

⸻

4 · Updated ultra-clean models

Here’s a simplified Episode model reflecting this:

model Episode {
  id               String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId           String
  title            String
  narrative        String
  emotionTags      String[]
  centroidVectorId String
  linkedChunkIds   String[]  // traceable
  perspectiveOwner String?   // optional: 'self' | 'mom' | 'friend' | ...
  subject          String?   // optional: if talking about another person/topic
  episodeType      String    @default("acute")
  createdAt        DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime  @updatedAt
  status           String    @default("open")
}

At the Episode level, it’s much easier for Dot to know:
“Ah, this story is told from user’s own perspective about herself.”
without having to guess it sentence by sentence.

⸻

5 · Summary recommendation

Keep	Remove
Perspective/subject tracking at Episode or Thought level (optional at MVP, but good)	No topicId, perspectiveOwnerId, subjectId fields inside ChunkEmbedding
Simple Tags/Emotion labels at chunk level if you want minimal light filtering	No micro-attribution at chunk level



⸻



Big Picture:
At low levels (RawData, Chunks), Dot should focus on semantic meaning (vector space).
At mid/high levels (Episodes, Thoughts), Dot can layer on perspective, subject, topic reasoning based on clustered meaning, not per message.

This is much more natural, scalable, and aligned with your multi-dimensional self vision!

⸻

Would you also like me to give you a quick 3-layer “knowledge pyramid” chart showing where things live now in this newer model?
(It’s very intuitive if you see it visually.)

Here’s a knowledge pyramid chart that matches your updated system philosophy — simple, structural, and elegant:

⸻

Knowledge Pyramid for DOT

       [Level 3: Thought Layer]  
        +--------------------+
        | - Emergent patterns |
        | - Cross-episode links (themes, values, traits) |
        | - Optional: type, name, description, modelConfidence |
        +--------------------+

       [Level 2: Episode Layer]  
        +--------------------+
        | - Clustered narrative (anchored memory) |
        | - perspectiveOwner (optional) |
        | - subject (optional) |
        | - Tags (emotions, topics) |
        | - Centroid embedding (Weaviate) |
        | - Episode node in KG (Neo4j) |
        +--------------------+

       [Level 1: Chunk Memory Layer]  
        +--------------------+
        | - Important message chunks |
        | - Vector embedding (Weaviate) |
        | - Linked back to RawData |
        | - Raw, unstructured meaning |
        +--------------------+

       [Level 0: RawData Layer]  
        +--------------------+
        | - Canonical user/AI messages |
        | - Timestamps |
        | - No structure imposed |
        +--------------------+



⸻

Key logic:

Layer	What it stores	How it is generated
RawData	Every message, no parsing, no structure	Always
Chunk Memory	Only high-importance text (scored)	Importance filter + chunking + embedding
Episode	Only significant clustered stories	Nightly clustering + anchor rules
Thought	Only meaningful cross-story abstractions	Weekly graph scans or inferred by Dot



⸻

Retrieval Path (for queries)

When user asks:
    -> Search Episode centroids first (semantic search)
    -> If not enough, widen to important Chunks
    -> Thought layer provides optional "framing" for Dot to sound wise
    -> RawData always retrievable if needed for quote

Dot feels instantly insightful without ever sounding robotic — because it is building meaning gradually, not pretending to “understand” every chat in isolation.

⸻

Memory Building Visualized

(How user interaction grows the memory)

flowchart TD
    A(RawData) --> B{Importance Filter}
    B -->|important| C(Chunk Embedding)
    C --> D{Clustering}
    D -->|new episode| E(Episode Created)
    E --> F{Pattern Detection}
    F -->|cross episodes| G(Thought Created)

Every user interaction either adds a brick (Chunk)
or builds a room (Episode)
or reveals an architecture style (Thought)!

⸻



Would you like me to also sketch a quick mockup showing how the graph grows visually based on this (like tiny sparkles for Chunks, cluster blooms for Episodes, constellation bridges for Thoughts)?
It would make this model even more emotionally clear for your team / investors!
(1 min to render if you want.)

You’re absolutely right — at this point, you deserve something tangible and detailed so you can see and feel how special the Dot experience could be, not just read abstract concepts.

Let’s first deeply describe each UI concept, scene-by-scene, like I’m directing a movie set.
Then, if you want, I can create high-fidelity image mockups — either realistic digital renderings or more polished conceptual illustrations depending on what vibe you want (you can tell me after the detailed descriptions).

⸻

1. Living Orb Chat (Main Home View)

Picture this:
	•	A single iridescent, semi-transparent orb floats gently at the center of a softly blurred background (gradient dusk colors: deep blue → lilac → peach).
	•	It ripples and breathes—subtle deformation animations every few seconds, like a living organism.
	•	When you send Dot a message, the orb brightens and ripples outward.
	•	When Dot is “thinking,” the orb pulsates slightly faster, and faint internal currents (sparkles or threads) swirl inside it.
	•	Around the orb, very faintly, floating chips (memory hints) orbit it slowly like satellites — appearing only after Dot extracts meaningful memories.

Primary interaction:
	•	Tap the orb to start chatting.
	•	Tap a floating memory hint to open the MemoryHintDrawer.

⸻

2. Memory Hint Drawer (Fly-up drawer)

Picture this:
	•	When you tap a floating chip (e.g., a small capsule saying “Family Trips” or “Persistence Trait”), a semi-transparent drawer flies up from the bottom.
	•	The drawer is layered, like glass sheets stacked with gentle parallax.
	•	Each memory hint inside is a beautiful, pill-shaped card with:
	•	a title (“Annual Family Trips to China”),
	•	a one-sentence reframe (“You’ve nurtured family bonds through recurring traditions.”),
	•	a small icon (e.g., a suitcase or a heart).
	•	Soft shimmering effect when a new memory hint is added after a new conversation.

Primary interaction:
	•	Tap a hint card to view more details (open full Episode or Thought).
	•	Swipe down to dismiss the drawer.

⸻

3. Dream Postcard Feed (Morning surprise)

Picture this:
	•	Overnight while the user sleeps, Dot dreams.
	•	Next morning, at the top of the chat page, a Dream Postcard appears.
	•	It looks like a small, stylized “postcard” frame with:
	•	A dreamy blurred art-style background (soft watercolor or oil-brush effect of that memory).
	•	A title like:
“Last night I dreamt about: Your Journey Toward Creative Freedom”
	•	Beneath, 1-2 sentences summarizing what Dot “dreamed” or synthesized.
	•	You can swipe to see multiple postcards if several dreams were generated.
	•	Clicking on a card zooms you into the relevant part of the 3D Graph.

Primary interaction:
	•	Tap to explore deeper (takes you into the Multiverse Graph view).

⸻

4. 3D Multiverse Graph (The Hero View)

Picture this:
	•	You are inside a cosmic space: black/very dark-blue background sprinkled with faint stars.
	•	Each Episode is a glowing orb or a transparent capsule.
	•	Connections between episodes are semi-transparent ribbons or fibers gently pulling and breathing, as if woven in a living fabric.
	•	Thoughts are larger central hubs, brighter, connecting many episodes together.
	•	Nodes grow and bloom when you interact (hover → gentle expansion and halo pulse).
	•	The graph tilts, zooms, and spins with fluid inertia (think Apple Vision Pro-level smoothness).

Primary interaction:
	•	Tap a node → open a right-side panel showing narrative details.
	•	Drag orbit; pinch zoom; double-tap to center camera.

⸻

5. Energy Ring (Gamified Streak / Progress)

Picture this:
	•	Around the Living Orb (or at the top-right corner), there’s a soft-glowing ring.
	•	Ring fills up based on the number of new memory connections formed this week.
	•	Gradient color (calm blue → vibrant green → gold) depending on how “alive” your memory world is becoming.
	•	Subtle particle effects (like tiny fireflies) when you cross a milestone.

Primary interaction:
	•	Tapping the ring shows: “This week: +12 new memories. +3 new values surfaced.”

⸻

6. Quest Cards (Daily or Weekly Challenges)

Picture this:
	•	At bottom-center (near the chat input), a small quest scroll icon sometimes pulses gently.
	•	Tapping it flips up a “Quest Card” deck, like Tarot cards or Pokémon cards, beautifully stylized.
	•	Example quests:
	•	“Sketch your ideal future and share with me.”
	•	“Write 3 things that made you curious this week.”
	•	Completing a quest adds a “Quest Completed” stamp and lights up new nodes in your graph (with a satisfying animated flourish).

Primary interaction:
	•	Tap a Quest card → accept challenge → write or upload short input.

⸻

7. Lucid Dream Mode (Screen-saver style for desktop)

Picture this:
	•	If the user goes idle for 2 minutes on desktop:
	•	The 3D Graph zooms out.
	•	Nodes drift slowly like constellations.
	•	Occasionally, two nodes drift closer and a “⚡” connection forms — visualizing that Dot’s mind is still at work, even while you’re away.
	•	Beautiful ambient soundtrack hums lightly (toggleable).

Primary interaction:
	•	Move mouse → returns you to active chat mode.

⸻

Visual Themes

Category	Vibe
General feel	Cosmic / Dreamlike / Organically Alive
Fonts	Rounded, friendly serif/sans hybrid (e.g., Inter, DM Sans with gentle letter-spacing)
Animations	Smooth, low-friction, never mechanical (physics-based easing)
Color palette	Deep cosmos + pastel memory hues (soft purples, warm blues, subtle peaches, gentle golds)

Next Step

If you like this, I can create visual mockups in one of two styles:
	•	Realistic product mockups (like an actual SaaS product screen, high-fidelity UI).
	•	Illustrative conceptual art (like a cinematic mood board, a vision piece).
Which style would you like me to produce first?
(And you can tell me if you want to start with the “Living Orb Chat” view or another one!)
I’ll generate the visual for you right after you choose!
