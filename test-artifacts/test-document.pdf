  # Introduction to Quantum Computing
  
  Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and
  entanglement to perform computations. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits (qubits)
  can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
  
  ## Key Concepts
  
  1. Superposition: Qubits can exist in multiple states at once
  2. Entanglement: Quantum particles become correlated in ways that cannot be explained by classical physics
  3. Quantum Gates: Manipulate qubits to perform computations
  
  ## Potential Applications
  
  - Cryptography and security
  - Drug discovery and molecular modeling
  - Optimization problems
  - Machine learning acceleration
