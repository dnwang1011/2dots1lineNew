# Migration Log

## Session Summary (Date: 2025-05-02)

This session focused on completing Phase 2 and beginning Phase 3 & 4 tasks as outlined in `MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md`.

### Phase 2 Completion & Verification

*   **Verified Test Environment:** Confirmed the `.env.test` file, database setup script (`scripts/setup-test-db.js`), and associated documentation (`tests/TEST_SETUP.md`) are functional.
*   **Fixed `fileUploadService` Integration Tests:** Addressed previously failing error handling tests in `tests/integration/fileUpload.service.integration.test.js`. Refactored tests to use `try/catch` and confirmed all 7 tests in the suite now pass.
*   **Full Integration Test Suite Pass:** Ran all tests within `tests/integration` (`chat.service.integration.test.js` and `fileUpload.service.integration.test.js`) successfully, confirming no regressions were introduced.

### Phase 3 Progress: API, Background Tasks & E2E Testing

*   **Implemented Robust Background Job Queues (Phase 3, Step 2):**
    *   Confirmed `bullmq` dependency exists.
    *   Identified Redis configuration usage (`src/utils/redisConfig.js`) relying on `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` environment variables.
    *   Created `src/utils/queues.js` to initialize and export a dedicated `memoryProcessingQueue` using BullMQ.
    *   Refactored `src/services/chat.service.js` and `src/services/fileUpload.service.js` to replace direct calls to `memoryManager.processMemoryPipeline` with `addMemoryJob` calls, queuing tasks instead.
    *   Created a new worker script `src/workers/memoryProcessor.worker.js` to process jobs from the `memory-processing` queue.
    *   Added an npm script `worker:memory` to `package.json`.
    *   **Action Required:** Manually add `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` to `.env.test` (and eventually `.env`) as direct editing was blocked.
*   **Standardized API Response Structures (Phase 3, Step 3):**
    *   Analyzed response structures in `src/controllers/chat.controller.js`.
    *   Standardized success responses across `sendMessage`, `getChatHistory`, and `uploadFile` to use the format `{ success: true, data: { ... } }`.
    *   Identified and removed a dead error handler import/usage in `src/index.js`.
    *   Refactored the existing `expressErrorHandler` in `src/utils/errorHandler.js` to format error responses as `{ success: false, error: { code: '...', message: '...' } }`.
*   **Implemented End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Phase 3, Step 4 - Initial Setup):**
    *   Installed `supertest` as a dev dependency.
    *   Created `tests/e2e/chat.e2e.test.js` with initial setup (`beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterAll`) including DB setup via script, authentication token generation, and AI mocking.
    *   Added initial E2E tests for `POST /api/chat` (success, validation error, auth error) and `POST /api/chat/upload` (image success, no file error), asserting against the newly standardized response structures.
    *   Added `npm run test:e2e` script to `package.json`.
    *   **Note:** Further E2E test expansion is needed (document uploads, history endpoint, other error cases). May require adjustment to `src/index.js` for proper app exporting for Supertest.

## Session Summary (Date: 2025-05-03) - Phase 3 Completion

This session focused on completing Phase 3 tasks and addressing previously identified risks and issues.

### Issue Resolution

* **Fixed Express App Export for E2E Testing:** Modified `src/index.js` to export the Express app instance (`module.exports.app = app`) while maintaining the server export. This enables Supertest to properly test API endpoints without starting the server.
* **Verified Queue Robustness:** Reviewed the `src/utils/queues.js` implementation and confirmed that it includes proper retry logic with exponential backoff (`attempts: 3` with exponential backoff), and failed job handling (`removeOnFail: 1000`).
* **Verified Error Handling Consistency:** Confirmed that the chat controller consistently uses standardized error handling through the `next(error)` pattern with the centralized `expressErrorHandler`.
* **Fixed Redis Configuration Inconsistency:** Identified and fixed an issue in the Redis configuration import where `queues.js` expected a connection object but `redisConfig.js` exported a function. Updated both `queues.js` and `memoryProcessor.worker.js` to properly call the `getRedisConfig()` function.
* **Added Redis Configuration to Environment:** Successfully added Redis configuration to `.env.test` to support background job processing in test environments.

### Phase 3 Completion

* **Expanded E2E Test Coverage (Phase 3, Step 4 - Completion):**
  * Added document upload tests to validate PDF handling.
  * Implemented comprehensive tests for the chat history endpoint, covering success cases, parameter validation, and authorization.
  * Added test for missing session_id on uploads.
  * Added tests for both found and not-found sessions in history endpoint.

* **Implemented Asynchronous File Upload Processing (Phase 3, Step 1):**
  * Created a `FileUploadJob` model in the Prisma schema to track job status and results.
  * Created and applied the necessary migration (`prisma migrate dev --name add_file_upload_job`).
  * Implemented a new `uploadFileAsync` controller method that returns immediately with a job ID and 202 status.
  * Added `/api/chat/upload/async` and `/api/chat/upload/status/:jobId` endpoints.
  * Enhanced the memory processor worker to handle the new `processFileUpload` job type.
  * Implemented file job status tracking with appropriate error handling.
  * Added comprehensive E2E tests for the asynchronous file upload flow.

### Phase 3 Verification

* **Successfully reset and migrated database schema** to include the new `FileUploadJob` model.
* **Validated E2E tests** for both synchronous and asynchronous API endpoints.
* **Verified the robust job queue processing** including retry logic, monitoring and error handling.

## Session Summary (Date: 2025-05-04) - Phase 4 Cleanup & Polish

This session focused on completing Phase 4 tasks as outlined in the migration roadmap, specifically targeting cleanup of debugging code, migration remnants, and generally polishing the codebase.

### Debug Code Removal (Phase 4, Step 1)

* **Replaced Console Logging with Structured Logging:**
  * Converted all `console.log` statements in `src/index.js` to proper `logger.info` calls, ensuring consistent log format.
  * Ensured error conditions use appropriate `logger.error` calls with full context information.
  * Removed unnecessary debug messages while keeping important startup and status information.

* **Organized Debug-Level Logging:**
  * Reviewed all `logger.debug` statements across the codebase.
  * Kept strategic debug logs in place for troubleshooting, but ensured they follow a consistent pattern and include appropriate context.

### Migration Remnants Cleanup (Phase 4, Step 2)

* **Removed V1/V2 Migration References:**
  * Removed legacy `V1 Cleanup` comment blocks in `src/services/memoryManager.service.js`.
  * Removed references to `V2 memory models` and outdated class names, providing cleaner and more forward-looking naming conventions.

* **Replaced Deprecated Flags:**
  * Replaced the legacy `forceImportant` flag with a more descriptive `skipImportanceCheck` flag in memory management code.
  * Updated all corresponding tests in `tests/services/memoryManager.service.test.js` and `tests/repositories/rawData.repository.test.js`.
  * Updated metadata collection to store the new flag name consistently.

* **Archived Migration Scripts and Documents:**
  * Moved legacy migration scripts (`backfill-memory-v2.js` and `migrate-memory-v1-v2.ts`) to `scripts/archive/`.
  * Moved testing and debugging scripts (`test-memory.js` and `temp_query_episodes.js`) to `src/archive/`.
  * Created a `migrations-docs` folder and moved migration-related documentation.
  * Preserved these files for reference while keeping the active codebase clean.

## Session Summary (Date: 2025-05-05) - Phase 4 Completion

This session completed the Phase 4 cleanup and polish tasks, with a particular focus on documentation, frontend code cleanup, and finalizing the migration.

### Frontend Code Cleanup (Phase 4, Step 4)

* **Removed Console.log Statements from Frontend Code:**
  * Removed all `console.log` statements from `public/js/chat.js` to improve production readiness.
  * Preserved key UI functionality while removing debug logging.
  * Ensured error handling continued to report issues to users appropriately through the UI.

### Comprehensive Documentation (Phase 4, Step 5)
