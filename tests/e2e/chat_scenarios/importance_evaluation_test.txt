## High Importance: Significant Life Events
I just got engaged last weekend! My partner proposed during our hike to the top of Mount Rainier.

We're thinking of getting married next summer, probably in June or July when the weather is nice.

## Low Importance: Small Talk
How's the weather today? It seems a bit cloudy outside.

I think I might order pizza for dinner tonight. Not sure if I want pepperoni or veggie.

## Medium Importance: Personal Preferences
I've always loved reading science fiction, especially authors like Asimov and Le Guin. Their ability to create entire worlds is amazing.

For music, I tend to listen to indie rock and folk. My favorite band is Fleet Foxes.

## High Importance: Work/Career Details
I'm working on a major project at work - we're developing a new machine learning system for medical diagnostics.

The system uses computer vision to analyze medical images and detect early signs of cancer. It could potentially save thousands of lives.

## Low Importance: Random Thoughts
I wonder if dogs dream about chasing squirrels. They always seem to move their paws while sleeping.

Blue used to be my favorite color when I was a kid, but now I tend to prefer green.

## High Importance: Personal Goals
One of my biggest goals is to start my own healthcare technology company within the next five years.

I want to create accessible medical AI tools for underserved communities around the world.

## Medium Importance: Challenges
I'm finding it difficult to balance my demanding job with making time for my new fianc√© and wedding planning.

Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, but I'm trying to take things one day at a time.

## Memory Test for Importance Evaluation
Can you tell me about my engagement? When and where did it happen?

What kind of project am I working on at my job?

What are my long-term career goals?

Do you remember what I said about my favorite color?

Can you remind me what I'm struggling with in terms of work-life balance?
