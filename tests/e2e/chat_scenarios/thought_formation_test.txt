## Episode 1: Work-Life Balance Struggles
I've been really struggling with work-life balance lately. I'm working 60+ hours a week and barely have time for anything else.

My health is starting to suffer too. I'm not sleeping well, and I've had to cancel my gym membership because I never had time to go.

I know I should set better boundaries at work, but I'm afraid of being seen as not committed enough.

## Episode 2: Career Development
I've been at my current company for 5 years now. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, but I feel like I'm not growing as much anymore.

There's a promotion opportunity coming up, but I'm not sure if I want it. It would mean even more responsibility and probably longer hours.

Sometimes I wonder if I should look for opportunities elsewhere, but I'm comfortable with my team and the company culture.

## Episode 3: Personal Values Reflection
I've been doing some reflection lately about what really matters to me. When I was younger, career success was everything.

Now I'm starting to value personal time, health, and relationships more. I want to feel like I'm living a meaningful life, not just a productive one.

My parents always emphasized hard work and achievement, so there's some guilt when I think about prioritizing other things.

## Episode 4: Future Planning
In five years, I'd like to be in a position where I have more control over my schedule.

Maybe that means a different role, or even starting my own business. I have some savings, but not enough to completely start over.

I also want to have time for personal projects and maybe even start a family. That feels impossible with my current lifestyle.
