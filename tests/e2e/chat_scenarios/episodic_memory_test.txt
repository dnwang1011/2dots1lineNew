## First Topic: Travel Experience (Episode 1)
I visited Japan last year for a two-week trip. It was an amazing experience!

We started in Tokyo and spent 4 days exploring the city. The blend of modern technology and traditional culture was fascinating.

Kyoto was my favorite city though. The temples and gardens were so peaceful, especially Kinkaku-ji and the bamboo forest in Arashiyama.

The food in Japan was incredible too. I tried everything from ramen and sushi to okonomiyaki and takoyaki.

## Unrelated Topic (Different Episode)
I've been learning to play the guitar for about 6 months now. It's been challenging but rewarding.

I can play a few songs now, mostly basic ones like "Wonderwall" and "Hey There Delilah".

## Back to Japan Topic (Continue Episode 1)
One thing I forgot to mention about Japan was how efficient their train system is. The shinkansen (bullet train) was an experience in itself.

I also visited an onsen (hot spring) in Hakone. The views of Mount Fuji while soaking in the hot spring were unforgettable.

## New Topic: Career (Episode 2)
I've been working at a tech company for the past 3 years as a product manager.

Recently, I've been feeling like I need a change. I'm considering either switching to a different industry or possibly starting my own business.

I've always been passionate about sustainability and environmental issues. Maybe I could find a way to combine my tech background with that passion.

## Memory Test for Episodes
Can you tell me about my trip to Japan? What were some of the highlights?

What musical instrument am I learning to play?

What's my current job, and what am I considering for my future career?

## Time Gap Marker (Several hours later...)
I've been thinking more about my career change. I think I might want to explore opportunities in renewable energy or sustainable technology. Do you have any advice on making such a transition from a product management role?
